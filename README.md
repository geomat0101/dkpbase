This is a "Dragon-Kill Point" framework that was developed in the early 2000s to
manage Raiding activity and loot distribution for the 40MD (40 Million Daggers)
Guild Coalition during the time of the original Vanilla World of Warcraft 40-man dungeons.

Somehow it has survived all these years.  It's in php3 and contains some torturous CSS.  
It's probably not a good idea to run any of this or use it as an example for modern
applications, but it definitely served its purpose at the time.

I place it upon this altar for posterity, and if any of the dozens of raiders from back then
happen upon it, may it inspire a bit of nostalgia for those days the same way it does for me.
