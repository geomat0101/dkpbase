If you have a full backup of another instance, just restore that and don't worry about anything in this directory



To set up a new instance of the system, the SQL files must be executed in this order:

dkpschema.sql
dkpconstraints.sql
initialize_lookup_tables.sql



If you have a data-only dump of another instance that you are restoring, then do this:

dkpschema.sql
<import data file>
dkpconstraints.sql

Do not run initialize_lookup_tables.sql when restoring data from another instance
